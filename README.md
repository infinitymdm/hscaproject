This repository contains my work on the FPDIV Goldscmidt divider and square root module.

The files are organized as follows:
* SystemVerilog files, testbenches, and .DO files are in the `hdl` directory.
* Previously submitted memos are in the `memos` directory. 
* Dependencies provided by Dr. Stine are in the `Wallace` and `fptests` directories.
* Two Rust programs I wrote while learning single-precision floating point format and Goldschmidt division are found in the `f32unpack` and `gdiv_rs` directories. 
* Diagrams and a detailed description of the sequence of operations for division and square root are found in `FPDIV_diagrams.drawio.pdf`.
